    h2 I FOCUS ON
  article.content.col-lg-8
    p Building innovative tools, supporting communities, teaching, learning, and shaping the environments in which the open web is made possible. Forget about design, I’m interested in how people think. Growing up around a family of musicians and artists, I decided to pursue meaning in art. After taking a slight detour upon realizing I was not cut out to be the next Jackson Pollock, I endeavoured into the digital realm. Being a designer allows me to focus on the microinteractions of an experience, and I extend that to the code that I write each and every day. My studies are founded upon a theoretical background. However, I combine this with fierce design skills and top interactive development. Best of both worlds, wouldn’t you say?
  
    p I’m interested in culture, design, aesthetic, wit, reality, existence, history, education, thought, and the happiness of pursuit.

    h2 My superpowers are...
  article.content.col-lg-8
    p Creating unparalleled user experiences through visual theory as the basis of any of my work. Alright alright, you can call me a bookworm. But any meaningful user experience is grounded on strong theoretical practice. I have become extremely interested, entranced if you will, in interactive development. I see building a website/web application/mobile application as a puzzle to a larger scheme of social interaction. The Internet has become a vast galaxy of informational escapades, visual symphonies, and usability giants. Through my love of Romance languages, I have developed the knack for learning programming languages with a creative approach. I practice all of the latter while maintaining design and user experience principles in high gear.
    p People call us Front-End Developers; they call us UX Designers. I digress, we are crafters of emotional impact
